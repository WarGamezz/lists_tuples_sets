#! Sequential Data Types
# Python provides for six sequence (or sequential) data types:
# strings
# byte sequences
# byte arrays
# lists
# tuples
# range objects

# Strings, lists, tuples, bytes and range objects may look like utterly different things, but nevertheless they have some underlying concepts in common:
# * The items or elements of strings, lists and tuples are ordered in a defined sequence
# * The elements can be accessed via indices

#? strings
# refer to hello_world GIT

#? byte sequences - don't see it being usefull at the moment
# The bytes() method returns a bytes object which is an immmutable (cannot be modified) sequence of integers in the range 0 <=x < 256.

#? byte arrays  - don't see it being usefull at the moment
#bytearray() objects are a mutable counterpart to bytes objects.
